        <p class="text-gray-700">
          Founded in 2018 by a visionary urban planner and a civil rights sheikh, the Sanctuary of Freewheeling views driving as a spiritual expression of freedom. Advocating for the belief that fines impede this sacred right, they promote driving as a crucial part of personal and communal connection. Their efforts are geared towards reshaping policies that affect drivers, especially under restrictive traffic regulations.
